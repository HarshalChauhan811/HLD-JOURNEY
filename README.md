## 🌟 About This Repository
This repository documents my **complete High Level Design journey**, starting from
basic system design fundamentals to **designing large-scale real-world systems like Bitly, Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp & Google Docs**.

This is not about writing code.  
This is about **thinking like a system designer**.

You will learn:
- How systems scale
- Why trade-offs exist
- How real companies design architecture
- How to explain designs confidently in interviews
